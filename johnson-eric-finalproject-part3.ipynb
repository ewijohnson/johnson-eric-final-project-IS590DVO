Glaciers form high in the mountains, and at sea level. They are found at the poles and in countries near the equator. They come in different types, forming in different places and because of different reasons. Do any of these factors correlate with glacier size? These visualizations will explore this question. \n",

    "To start off our glacial exploration, let's consider the elevations where glaciers form. Glaciers form near the sea at both poles, where lengthy winters allow for vast expanses of ice. Glaciers also form in the mountains, where the temperatures can be significantly colder than at the base - for example, there are glaciers in places like South Africa and Venezuela! But is there a correlation between glacier size and elevation? Where do the largest glaciers form? Are they closer to sea level, or are the largest high up in the mountains?

Continental Ice Sheet, for example, is a glacier that covers areas of continental land masses, such as the glaciers that cover Greenland.$^{3}$ An Ice Shelf is a glacier that floats on the sea and is connected to another glacier on the coast - the most famous example of this is the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica.$^{4}$ And a Valley Glacier is a glacier that has formed in a valley.$^{5}$ The other glacier types can be easily looked up for more detailed information, and the User Guide for this data set provides a brief explanation of each type as well, which can be found in the sources at the end of this article.$^{1}$"

This rainfall data for each country was gathered from worldbank.org.$^{2}$ The visualizations here will also compare elevation relative to rainfall, to see if there are any connections between elevation and rainfall and glacier area. Rainfall could potentially have a correlation with glacier size because precipitation falling in a cold area could lead to snow or ice, which could be an indicator of locations where glaciers are more likely to form, and where they do form, are more likely to be larger in size. Elevation is included in these comparisons because in some places, elevation does have a correlation with rainfall, due to cooling of air as it rises over mountains. Take a look at the following visualizations to see if rainfall and elevation have a correlation with glacier size!"

    "Taking a look at the three plots above, we see average glacier elevation and average glacier area in the top row, and average rainfall at the bottom. These plots were made by averaging all information about glaciers by country, rather than longitude and latitude segments as before, due to the nature of the rainfall data. Therefore, each data point on these plots represents all of the data for a single country. The locations of the points were chosen to represent the average of the latitudes and longitudes of all glaciers in that country (so, for example, the points that represent the United States glaciers are up where Alaska is, since that's where the majority of glaciers in the United States exist, skewing the average latitude and longitudes up north). \n",
    "\n",
    "It seems there is not much of a correlation between average rainfall and glacier size. There is somewhat of a correlation between rainfall and elevation, although only in some areas (the Himalayas/Tibetan Plateau are one major exception). Even though there isn't a correlation here, that's okay, because we've eliminated another variable as to why some glaciers are larger than others - we know that average rainfall doesn't seem to have any effect on glacier size. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, to summarize these groups of visualizations, there are many potential reasons why glaciers vary in size. We've explored a couple of those hypotheses here, including elevation, glacier type, and average rainfall. And hopefully you've learned more about glaciers in the process! "
