    "Our world contains many glaciers, ranging in size from over 11,000 square kilometeres to less than a fraction of a square kilometer. Why do glaciers come in such a wide variety of sizes? Glaciers form high in the mountains, and at sea level. They are found at the poles and in countries near the equator. They come in different types, forming in different places and because of different reasons. Do any of these factors correlate with glacier size? These visualizations will explore this question. \n",

    "To start off our glacial exploration, let's consider the elevations where glaciers form. Glaciers form near the sea at both poles, where lengthy winters allow for vast expanses of ice. Glaciers also form in the mountains, where the temperatures can be significantly colder than at the base - for example, there are glaciers in places like South Africa and Venezuela! But is there a correlation between glacier size and elevation? Where do the largest glaciers form? Are they closer to sea level, or are the largest high up in the mountains?

    "Finally, the plot above shows the glacier type by total area - that is, the area of all glaciers of that kind added together, rather than the average area for a glacier of that type. This graph shows us how much of the world's glaciers are which type of glacier. As expected, there are more Continental Ice Sheets than any other glacier type on Earth. Interestingly, this plot looks very similar to the log scale plot of average glacier area we looked at previously - reassuring us that glacier type is a good indicator of relatively how large or small a glacier will be - seemingly regardless of other factors. \n",

    "For part 3, we'll take a look at an additional factor - rainfall. Does rainfall in an area influence glacier size? This rainfall data for each country was gathered from worldbank.org.$^{2}$ The visualizations here will also compare elevation relative to rainfall, to see if there are any connections between elevation and rainfall and glacier area. Rainfall could potentially have a correlation with glacier size because precipitation falling in a cold area could lead to snow or ice, which could be an indicator of locations where glaciers are more likely to form, and where they do form, are more likely to be larger in size. Elevation is included in these comparisons because in some places, elevation does have a correlation with rainfall, due to cooling of air as it rises over mountains. Take a look at the following visualizations to see if rainfall and elevation have a correlation with glacier size!"

    "We've learned a lot information about glaciers and glacier size! First we took a look at glaciers and max elevation, to see if there was any relationship between max elevation and where the largest area of glaciers are. Then we looked to see if the type of glacier is correlated in any way with its average size, and we learned that Continental Ice Sheets are on average, much larger than all other glacier types. We learned that of all the glaciers on Earth, after Continental Ice Sheets, the most glacial area is found in Valley Glaciers, Outlet Glaciers, and Mountain Glaciers. Finally, we saw that the average rainfall of a country does not seem to be correlated with the average glacier size of that country, and neither of those are correlated with the average maximum glacier elevation of that country.  \n",

We could also look at minimum elevation of each glacier, and see if there are any interesting relationships with that, especially when compared to the max elevation that we looked at here. \n",
